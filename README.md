# IonicCapacitorVideoTrancoder

This code currently performs video transcoding with static height, width, trim start time, and trim end time values. 
For future development, all these values will be dynamically adjustable based on user input. 
This implementation is in an Ionic 7 app using Capacitor 5, utilizing the 'filePicker' plugin for file selection, 
and 'video transcoder' for video transcoding on Android devices.
